            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>Norther enlisted my student team at General Assembly to help revamp their current website and content strategy.</p>
            <p><em>"Our current business model is to leverage off the growth of our social media accounts. We would love it if you could redesign the website to highlight the national parks and draw attention from the socials to the website."</em></p>
            
            <h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>51.6% Age 24-44</strong></li>
                <li><strong>66.7% Research trips with social media</strong></li>
                <li><strong>62.1% Do not plan travel with children</strong></li>
                <li><strong>54.8% Research trips on Mobile</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>To provide focused park information, insider insights, and resources to help educate and plan fulfilling destination visits, while helping them adapt to unexpected circumstances during their visit.</p>
            
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>Our recommendations provided Norther with a clear path forward to bridge their successful social media presence with a purposeful web experience.</p>

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The AI agent platform was experiencing a <strong>40% drop-off rate</strong> during complex task flows. Users were abandoning workflows midway through multi-step processes.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Problems Identified</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Overload:</strong> Too many choices presented simultaneously</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Issues:</strong> Users couldn't assess AI recommendation confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Context Loss:</strong> Multi-step processes lacked continuity</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> No clear way to refine AI outputs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Design Solution</h2>
            <p>Redesigned the interface as a <em>guided conversation</em>, breaking complex tasks into digestible questions with smart defaults and AI confidence indicators.</p>
            
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task completion rate:</strong> 60% ‚Üí 87% (+45%)</li>
                <li><strong>Average session time:</strong> 3.2min ‚Üí 5.8min (+81%)</li>
